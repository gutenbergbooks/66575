<p><span class="smcap">The</span> greatest physical convulsion of recent times
occurred on the morning of the 27th of August
last year, the scene of the catastrophe being a
small island in the Sunda Straits, which separate
Sumatra and Java. It is a region which there is
much reason to regard as one of the intensest foci
of volcanic activity on the earth’s surface. The
main facts connected with this event, although
slow in coming to hand, are now fairly within
the records of science. Krakatoa, the volcanic
island which a year or two ago was seven miles
long by five broad, is about thirty miles from
the Java coast. When surveyed in 1868-69, the
island was found to be clothed from base to
summit with a luxuriant growth of forest and
tropical vegetation, but uninhabited. A few
weeks prior to the eruption, the volcano, which
had been dormant for two centuries, gave
signs of an awakening. On the 20th of May
several shocks, accompanied by loud explosions
and hollow reverberations, startled the inhabitants
of the towns of Batavia and Buitenzorg,
about ninety miles distant.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> These disturbances
continued for the next three months with more
or less activity. On the 11th and 18th of August
the energy of the volcano increased, and there
were symptoms of a crisis. On the 26th and
the night following, several eruptions took place,
until the climax was reached on the following
morning. The submarine base of the mountain
then seems, according to all available evidence,
to have literally ‘caved in.’ This was apparently
accompanied by an influx of the sea into the
molten interior, the instantaneous development
of superheated steam, and then an explosion
which, for its colossal energy, is unparalleled in
the annals of volcanic outbreaks.</p>

<p>The enormous power of this eruption can only
be adequately understood by its effects; these
we now briefly summarise. The explosion itself,
according to Dr Verbeek, one of the Dutch
Commission appointed to investigate the nature
and results of this catastrophe, caused the
north part of the island to be blown away, and
to fall eight miles to the north, forming
what is now named Steer’s Island. Moreover,
the north-east portion of the island of
Krakatoa was also hurled into the air, passed
over Lang Island, and fell at a distance of seven
miles, forming what is now known as Calmeyer
Island. In proof of this, we have the fact
elicited by the newly made marine survey of
the Straits, that ‘<i>the bottom surrounding these new
islands has not risen</i>.’ This would have been
the case had they been upheaved in the usual
way. Not only so, but the bottom round these
new islands shows a slightly <i>increased depth</i> in
the direction of the submarine pit, nearly one
thousand feet deep, which now marks the place
the peak of Krakatoa occupied prior to the convulsion.
But out of the midst of this deep depression
there rises ‘like a gigantic club’ a remarkable
column of rock of an area not more than
thirty-three square feet, which projects sixteen feet
above the surface of the sea. The southern part
is all that is now left of the island of Krakatoa,
and this fragment on its north side is now
bounded by a magnificent precipitous cliff more
than two thousand five hundred feet high. It
has been thought by some, however, that the
first portion of the island was blown away on
the evening of August 26th, and that on the
following morning the larger mass, answering to
Calmeyer Island, was shot out by an effort still
more titanic.</p>

<p>The shock of the explosion was felt at a
distance of four thousand miles, being equal to
an area of one-sixth of the earth’s surface—that
is, at Burmah, Ceylon and the Andaman Islands
to the north-west, in some parts of India, at
Saigon and Manila to the north, at Dorey in
the Geelvink Bay (New Guinea) to the east, and
throughout Northern Australia to the south-west.
Lloyd’s agents at Batavia, in Java, stated that on
the eve of this vast explosion, the detonations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_706">{706}</span>
‘grew louder, till in the early morning the
reports and concussions were simply deafening,
not to say alarming.’ So violent were the air-waves,
due to this cause, that walls were rent
by them at a distance of five hundred miles,
and so great the volume of smoke and ashes,
that Batavia, eighty miles off, was shrouded in
complete darkness for two hours. Nearly four
months after the eruption, masses of floating
pumice, each several acres in extent, were seen
in the Straits of Sunda.</p>

<p>Paradoxical as it appears, the sound was sometimes
better heard in distant places than in those
nearer the seat of disturbance. This singular
effect has been thus explained—assuming, for
example, the presence of a thick cloud of ashes
between Krakatoa and Anjer, this would act on
the sound-waves like a thick soft cushion; along
and above such an ash-cloud the sound would
be very easily propelled to more remote places,
for instance, Batavia; whereas at Anjer, close
behind the ash-cloud, no sounds, or only faint
ones, would be heard. Other explanations seem
to be less probable, though not impossible.</p>

<p>Dr Verbeek states that within a circle of nine
and a-half miles’ radius (fifteen kilomètres) from
the mountain, the layers of volcanic ash cover
the ground to a depth of from sixty-five to
one hundred and thirty feet, and at the back
of the island the thickness of the ash-mountains
is in some places even from one hundred and
ninety-five to two hundred and sixty feet, and
that the matter so projected extends over a known
area of seven hundred and fifty thousand square
kilomètres (285,170 square miles), or a space
larger than the German Empire with the Netherlands
and Belgium, including Denmark and Iceland,
or nearly twenty-one times the size of the
Netherlands. Moreover, he calculates that the
quantity of solid substance ejected by the volcano
was eighteen cubic kilomètres, or 4.14 <i>cubic
miles</i>. To give some idea of the enormous volume
this represents, we may take the following illustration:
the largest of the Egyptian pyramids
has upwards of eighty-two millions of cubic feet
of masonry; it would therefore take about <i>seven
thousand three hundred and sixty of such structures</i>
to equal the bulk of matter thrown out by
this eruption. Some of this matter was found
to contain smooth round balls from five-eighths
to two and a-quarter inches in diameter, and composed
of fifty-five per cent. of carbonate of lime.</p>

<p>As may well be imagined, the final outburst
by its awful energy gave rise to a succession of
air-waves. These we now know went round the
earth more than once, and recorded themselves
on the registering barometers or barograms at
the Mauritius, Berlin, Rome, St Petersburg,
Valencia, Coimbra (Portugal), and other far-distant
places. At some points, as many as seven
such disturbances were noted; other instruments
not so sensitive gave evidence of five, by
which time the wave had pretty well spent itself.</p>

<p>Having collected the observations made at all
the chief meteorological stations, General Strachey
recently read a paper before the Royal Society
which, in his opinion, conclusively shows that an
immense air-wave started from Krakatoa at about
thirty minutes past nine <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on August 27th.
Spreading from this common centre, the wave
went three and a-quarter times round the globe,
and those parts of it which had travelled in
opposite directions passed through one another
‘somewhere in the antipodes of Java.’ The
velocity of the aërial undulations which travelled
from east to west was calculated at six hundred
and seventy-four miles per hour, those moving in
the reverse direction at seven hundred and six
miles per hour, or nearly the velocity of sound.</p>

<p>But another effect of the eruption was a
series of ‘tidal waves,’ so called—although the
term is objected to because not strictly scientific—which,
like the air-wave, passed round
the world. Whether this was synchronous with
the final explosion, it is not possible to say.
The highest of these seismic sea-waves, which
was over one hundred feet high, swept the shores
on either side of the Straits, and wrought terrible
destruction to life and property. More than
thirty-five thousand persons perished through it;
the greater part of the district of North Bantam
was destroyed, the towns of Anjer, Merak, Tjeringin,
and others being overwhelmed.</p>

<p>The initial movement of this destructive agent
was undoubtedly of the nature of a negative wave;
but the best testimony to this is lost, since those
who witnessed it were its victims. The sudden
subsidence of so large an area of the sea-bottom
in the Straits caused the sea to recede from the
neighbouring shores. This negative wave was,
however, seen by Captain Ferrat from his vessel,
as she lay at anchor at Port Louis. He states
that towards two <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> he saw the water in the
harbour roll back and suddenly fall four or five
feet; and that, a quarter of an hour afterwards,
the sea returned with great violence to its former
level, causing his own and other vessels to roll
terribly. The best witness of this remarkable
phenomenon, however, is Captain Watson, of the
British ship <i>Charles Ball</i>. His vessel was actually
within the Straits, and he states that he and his
helmsman ‘saw a wave rush right on to Button
Island, apparently sweeping right over the south
part, and rising half-way up to the north and
east sides fifty or sixty feet, and then continuing
on to the Java shore. This was evidently a
wave of translation and not of progression, for
it was not felt at the ship.’ This latter movement,
beyond question, must have coincided with
the great ‘tidal wave’ above mentioned, and
which was felt at Aden, on the Ceylon coast,
Port Blair, Nagapatam, Port Elizabeth, Kurrachee,
Bombay, and half-way up to Calcutta on
the Hooghly, the north-west coast of Australia,
Honolulu, Kadiall in Alaska, San Celeto near San
Francisco, and the east coast of New Zealand.</p>

<p>In this as in most other cases of volcanic
disturbance, electrical phenomena were observed.
One vessel in particular, while passing through
the Sunda Straits, exhibited ‘balls of fire’ at her
masthead and at the extremities of her yardarms.
Further, it was noticed at the Oriental Telephone
Station, Singapore, a place five hundred miles
from Krakatoa, that on raising the receiving
instrument to the ears, a perfect roar as of a
waterfall was heard; and by shouting at the top
of one’s voice, the clerk at the other end of the
wire was able just to hear something like articulation,
but not a single sentence could be understood.
On the line to Ishore, which includes
a submarine cable about a mile long, reports
like pistol-shots were heard. These noises were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_707">{707}</span>
considered due to a disturbance of the earth’s
magnetic field, caused by the explosion, and
reacting on the wires of the telephone.</p>

<p>We have now to refer to what has been a
much debated question. From about September
to the beginning of the present year, remarkable
coronal appearances and sunglows were noticed
in different parts of the world, and especially
the somewhat rare phenomena of red, green, and
blue suns. Observers such as Norman Lockyer,
Dr Meldrum, and Helmholtz maintained that
the phenomena were due to volcanic dust at a
great altitude; others, and notably meteorologists,
rejected this hypothesis, and urged that
the coloured suns were due to unusually favourable
atmospheric conditions, such colours being
probably due to the refraction and reflection of
light by watery vapours. But the theory that
volcanic dust caused these appearances is fast
gaining ground, if it be not already an incontrovertible
fact. The spectroscope has shown
that dust of almost microscopic fineness floating
in the air caused the sun to appear red. Such
dust has already fallen, and the microscope
reveals the existence in it of salt particles.
This, then, is fairly conclusive evidence of the
volcanic origin of such dust. That ash particles
were actually carried very far in the upper
air-currents, has already appeared from snow
which fell in Spain and rain in Holland, in
which the <i>same components</i> were found as in the
Krakatoa ashes. Dr Verbeek estimates that the
height to which this fine matter was projected
‘may very well have reached’ forty-five to sixty
thousand feet.</p>

<p>In a letter addressed to the <i>Midland Naturalist</i>
by Mr Clement Wragge, of Torrens Observatory,
Adelaide, South Australia, and dated July 17,
1884, the writer remarks that recently, when
there were magnificent sunsets, he obtained ‘a
perfectly sharp, clean spectrum without a trace
of vapour-bands.’ And further, he is strongly of
opinion that the Krakatoa eruption is the primary
cause of these wondrous pictures in the Kosmos.</p>

<p>There can now be little doubt but that the
green and blue suns and exceptional sunsets
observed in Europe, India, Africa, North and
South America, Japan, and Australia, were due
to the Krakatoa eruption. The enormous volume
of volcanic dust and steam shot up into the
higher atmospheric zones by this convulsion are
adequate to furnish the chromatic effects above
mentioned.</p>

<p>But we have better evidence still: these
peculiar solar effects followed a tolerably straight
course to one which was in fact chiefly confined
to a narrow belt near the equator; the data
now collected show that on the second day after
the eruption they appeared on the east coast of
Africa, on the third day on the Gold Coast, at
Trinidad on the sixth, and at Honolulu the
ninth day. Finally, in a paper read by Dr
Douglas Archibald at the late British Association
meeting at Montreal, it was stated that ‘observations
showed that the dates of the sunglows began
<i>earlier</i> in Java, then apparently spread gradually
away, the dust being so high as to be in the
upper currents, of which we know little. These
sunset glows were not seen before the eruption.... The
dust appeared to have travelled at a
uniform rate, over two thousand miles daily.’
‘The topic,’ says Mr S. E. Bishop, writing from
Honolulu, ‘is an endless one. Many ask what is
the cause of frequent revivals of the red glows,
such as the very fine one of August 19. It seems
merely to show an irregular distribution of the
vast clouds of thin Krakatoa haze still lingering
in the upper atmosphere. They drift about,
giving us sometimes more, sometimes less, of their
presence. It is also not unlikely that in varying
hygrometric conditions the minute dust-particles
become nuclei for ice crystals of varying size.
This would greatly vary their reflecting power,
and accords with some observations of Mr C. J.
Lyons, showing that the amount of red glow
varies according to the prevalence of certain
winds.’ Further facts are coming to hand respecting
this great natural convulsion.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LV.—SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after reading Mr Shield’s letter, Madge
walked to Ringsford with Pansy. There had
been a thaw during the night, and the meadows
and the ploughed lands were transformed into
sheets of dirty gray, dirty blue, and reddish slush,
according to the character of the soil, dotted
with patches of snow like the ghosts of islets
in a lake of puddle. But the red sun had a
frosty veil on his face; by-and-by this puddle
would be glazed with ice, and the heavy drops
of melting snow which were falling slowly from
the trees would become glittering crystal pendants
to their branches.</p>

<p>The two girls, their cheeks tingling with the
bite of the east wind, tramped bravely through
the slush, with no greater sense of inconvenience
than was caused by the fact that they would
be obliged to perform the journey by the road
instead of taking the short-cut through the
Forest.</p>

<p>They spoke little, for each was occupied with
her own troublous thoughts; Pansy did not know
much of the sources of her friend’s anxieties,
and Madge had already exhausted the consolation
she could offer to her companion. On arriving
at Ringsford they found Sam Culver attending
to his plants and greenhouses as methodically
as if the mansion stood as sound as ever it had
done and the daily supply of fruit and flowers
would be required as usual.</p>

<p>Madge left Pansy with her father, and went
on to the cottage. In the kitchen she found
Miss Hadleigh fast asleep in the gardener’s big
armchair. She would have left the room without
disturbing her, but at that moment Miss
Hadleigh yawned and awakened.</p>

<p>‘Don’t go away; I am not sleeping.—Oh,
it’s you, Madge. Isn’t this a dreadful
state of things? I haven’t had a wink of
sleep for two nights, and feel as if I should
drop on the floor in hysterics or go off into
a fever.’</p>

<p>Miss Hadleigh had been relieved by a good
many ‘winks’ during the period specified,
although, like many other nurses, she was convinced
that she had not closed her eyes all the
time. Madge accepted the assertion literally, and
was instantly all eagerness to relieve her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_708">{708}</span></p>

<p>‘You must get away to Willowmere at once,
and take a proper rest. You are not to refuse,
for I will take your place here and do whatever
may be required. You are looking so ill,
Beatrice, that I am sure Philip and—somebody
else would consider me an unfeeling creature if
I allowed you to stay any longer.’</p>

<p>‘But it is my duty to stay, dear,’ said Miss
Hadleigh a little faintly, for she did not like
to hear that she was looking ill.</p>

<p>‘And it is my duty to relieve you. Besides,
Dr Joy has given us some hope that it may
be safe to remove your father to our house
to-day; and then you will be there, refreshed
and ready to receive him.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose you are right—I am not fit for
much at present,’ said Miss Hadleigh languidly;
‘and you can do everything for him a great
deal better than I can. But I must wait till
Philip comes—he promised to be here early.’</p>

<p>‘You have heard from him, then?’</p>

<p>‘Heard from him!—he was here last night
as soon as he could get away from that nasty
business he has been swindled into by our nice
Uncle Shield. He ought to have taken poor
papa’s advice at the beginning, and have had
nothing to do with him.’</p>

<p>This was uttered so spitefully, that it seemed
as if there were an undercurrent of satisfaction
in the young lady’s mind at finding that the
rich uncle who would only acknowledge one
member of the family, had turned out a
deceiver.</p>

<p>Madge was astonished and chagrined by the
information that Philip had been out on the
previous evening and had made no sign to her;
but in the prospect of seeing him soon, she put
the chagrin aside, remembering how harassed he
was at this juncture in his affairs. There should
be no silly lovers’ quarrel between them, if she
could help it. She would take the plain, commonplace
view of the position, and make every
allowance for any eccentricity he might display.
She would help him in spite of himself, by
showing that no alteration of circumstances could
alter her love, and that she was ready to wait
for him all her life if she could not serve him in
any other way. To be sure, he had said the
engagement was at an end; and Uncle Dick
had not yet said that it was to stand good.
But she loved Philip: her life was his, and
misfortune ought to draw them nearer to one
another than all the glories of success—than
all the riches in the world.</p>

<p>When he came, there was no sign of astonishment
at her presence in the temporary refuge
of his father: he seemed to accept it as a matter
of course that she should be there. Neither was
there any sign that he remembered the manner
in which they had last parted. To her anxious
eyes he seemed to have grown suddenly very
old. The frank joyous voice was hushed into a
low grave whisper; the cheeks and eyes were
sunken; and there was in his manner a cold
self-possession that chilled her. Yet something in
the touch of his hand reassured her: love was
still in his heart, although the careless youth,
full of bright dreams and fancies, was changed
into the man, who, through loss and suffering,
had come to realise the stern realities of life.</p>

<p>They were for a time prevented from speaking
together in private because the doctors had
arrived only a few minutes before Philip, and he
waited to hear their report. Dr Joy came out
of the invalid’s room with an expression which
was serious but confident.</p>

<p>‘Our patient goes on admirably,’ he said. ‘You
need have no fear of any immediate danger;
and in six months there will be only a few scars
to show the danger he has passed through. I
am to stay here for a couple of hours, and then
I shall know whether or not we can move him
to Willowmere. By that time, too, I expect the
ambulance we wrote for last night will be here.—And
you, Miss Hadleigh, you really must take
rest. I insist upon it. You will not make your
father better by making yourself ill. Go and
get to bed. Philip and Miss Heathcote will do
everything that is necessary, and I shall be their
overseer.’</p>

<p>Philip went to the stables to tell Toomey to
bring the carriage round for his sister. As he
was crossing the little green on his way back
to the cottage, Madge met him. Although he
had not observed her approaching, his head being
bowed and eyes fixed on the ground, he took the
outstretched hands without any sign of surprise,
without any indication that he understood the
cruel significance of the ‘good-bye’ which had
caused them both so much pain. Whatever hesitation
she might have felt as to the course she
was to pursue was removed by his first words.</p>

<p>‘You want to speak to me, Madge,’ he said in
a tone of gentle gravity; and then with a faint
smile: ‘I am better than when you saw me last,
for I am free from suspense. My position is clear
to me now, and I feel that a man is more at ease
when the final blow falls and strikes him down,
than he can be whilst he is struggling vainly for
the goal he has not strength enough to reach.
It is a great relief to know that we are beaten
and to be able to own it. Then there is a possibility
of plodding on to the end without much
pain.’</p>

<p>She was as much alarmed by this absolute
surrender to adversity as she had been by the
strange humour which had prompted him to say
that she was free.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Philip, I want to speak to you,’ she said
tenderly, and a spasmodic movement of the hand
which grasped hers, signified that the electric
current of affection was not yet broken. She
went on the more earnestly: ‘I am not going
to think about the foolish things you have said
to me: I am going to ask you to give me your
confidence—to tell me everything that has happened
during the last two days. Tell it to me,
if you like, as to your friend.’</p>

<p>‘Always my friend,’ he muttered, bending forward
as if to kiss her brow, and then drawing
slowly back, like one who checks himself in the
commission of some error.</p>

<p>‘Always your friend,’ she echoed with emphasis,
‘and therefore you should be able to speak
freely.’</p>

<p>‘There is not much to tell you. The ruin is
more complete than even I imagined it to be,
and the fault is mine. Your friend—I ought to
say our friend—Mr Beecham has made a generous
offer for the business, and, with certain modifications,
will allow it to be carried on under my
management. This relieves us from immediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_709">{709}</span>
difficulties; and in a short time Mr Shield expects
to have recovered sufficiently from his recent
losses to be able to assist me in redeeming all
that has been lost.’</p>

<p>‘What gladder news could there be than this?’
she exclaimed with cheeks aglow and brightening
eyes; ‘and yet you tell it as if it gave you no
pleasure. Philip, Philip! this is not like you—it
is not right to be so melancholy when the
future is so bright.’</p>

<p>‘Is it so bright? Are you forgetting how
long it must be before I can repay Mr Shield?
before’——</p>

<p>He was going to say, ‘before I can ask you to
risk your future in mine, and what changes may
take place meanwhile!’</p>

<p>The earnest tender eyes were fixed upon him,
and they were reading his thoughts, whilst she
appeared to be waiting for him to complete the
interrupted sentence. She saw the colour slowly
rising on his brow, and knew that he was feeling
ashamed of the doubt implied in his thought.</p>

<p>‘I want to tell you something,’ she said in her
quiet brave way, ‘and I hope—no, I <i>believe</i> that it
will take one disagreeable fancy out of your head.
I know that you did not mean what you said
to me on that dreadful evening.’</p>

<p>‘What else could a ruined man say?’ (This
huskily and turning his face aside.)</p>

<p>‘He could say that he trusted his friends. Even
Uncle Dick is angry with you for imagining that
your misfortune could make any difference in his
feelings towards you. And for me, you <i>ought</i>
to say ... but there, I am not going to speak
about what you ought to say to me; I am only
going to tell you what I shall do.’</p>

<p>He looked quickly at her, and the eager inquiry
on his pale face rendered the words ‘What is
that?’ superfluous.</p>

<p>‘I shall wait until you come for me; and when
you come, I shall be ready to go with you where
you will, whether you are poor or rich. No
matter what anybody says—no matter what <i>you</i>
say, I shall wait.’</p>

<p>‘O Madge!’</p>

<p>He could say nothing more; the man’s soul
was in that whisper. Their hands were clasped:
they were looking into each other’s eyes: the
world seemed to sink away from them; and the
woman’s devotion changed the winter into summer,
changed the man’s ruin into success.</p>

<p>He drew her arm within his; and they walked
past the blackened walls of the Manor, and along
the paths where they had spent so many pleasant
hours during his recovery from the accident with
the horse, to the place where he had thrown off
the doctor’s control and got out of the wheel-chair.</p>

<p>‘I am not so sorry now for what has happened,’
were his first words. ‘It is worth losing everything
to gain so much.’</p>

<p>‘But you have not lost everything, Philip.’</p>

<p>‘No; I should say that I have won everything.
I am glad to have saved Wrentham from penal
servitude, for his frauds have enabled me to realise
the greatest of all blessings—the knowledge that
come what may you can make me happy.’</p>

<p>‘And I am happy too,’ she said softly, their
arms tightening as they walked on again in
silence.</p>

<p>By-and-by he lifted his head, and seemed to
shake the frost from his hair.</p>

<p>‘The doctor said I ought to have rest. I have
got it from you, Madge. I can look straight again
at the whole botheration—thank you, my darling.’
(A gentle pressure on his arm was the answer,
and he went on.) ‘The arrangement offered by
Beecham is a very good and kind one, which will
enable me in course of time to clear myself whilst
carrying out my scheme; we can take a small
house; Mr Shield will live with us, and we must
try to make him comfortable. Then we need
not wait for the end of next harvest, unless you
still insist’——</p>

<p>‘No, Philip; when you bid me come to you,
I am ready.’</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been abundantly shown by various writers
that the Indians of North America as well as
elsewhere looked upon tobacco as having a divine
origin, as being a peculiar and special gift
designed by the ‘Good Spirit’ for their delectation,
and that it held a prominent place in their
visions of a future life in the ‘happy hunting-grounds.’
In the present day, there seems to
be an ever increasing dependence on—we might
almost say slavery to—the plant, whose soothing
influences are called in quest to counteract the
effects of this high-pressure age. There are not
a few of its devotees who are quite at one with
Salvation Yeo in <i>Westward Ho</i>, who, when
speaking of tobacco, says: ‘For when all things
were made, none was made better than this; to
be a lone man’s companion, a bachelor’s friend,
a hungry man’s food, a sad man’s cordial, a
wakeful man’s sleep, and a chilly man’s fire.
There’s no herb like unto it under the canopy
of heaven.’ We do not, however, propose to
discuss the opposing views held by the smoker
and the anti-smoker, but intend to restrict ourselves
to some remarks on the manufacture of
cigars, which have been suggested by a recent
visit to the West Indies.</p>

<p>Of the endless varieties of cigars which are
met with in various tropical localities, the majority
are used for local consumption, and only find
their way into England in very small quantities.
The bulk of our cigars are either Havana or
Manila, European or British, and of these it
has been computed that considerably over two
hundred million are consumed annually in the
United Kingdom. It is evident, therefore, that
the manufacture of this luxury is a business of
great magnitude, irrespective of the other forms
of tobacco used; and if we remember that the
duty obtained from tobacco of all kinds puts
nearly nine millions per annum into the national
exchequer, it becomes possible to realise how
much the comfort and happiness of a large
number of Her Majesty’s subjects depend on the
products of the tobacco crop.</p>

<p>An Havana cigar of a good brand is deservedly
looked upon as the <i>crême de la crême</i> of cigars;
but, unfortunately, the number of good makers
as well as the possible production of first-class
cigars is necessarily limited. Thus the manufacture
of the ‘Villar y Villar’ brand is stated
to be never more than twenty-five thousand
daily; while that of ‘Henry Clays’ is fully three
times as many. For some time back there
has been a deterioration in Havanas, which has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_710">{710}</span>
been variously accounted for. It is asserted that,
from the exhaustive nature of the crop, guano
or other artificial stimulants are largely used,
and that the flavour of the leaf has suffered in
consequence. Besides, owing to the increasing
demand, tobacco has been grown on poor land
unsuitable for the production of the finest leaf,
and even has been largely imported into Cuba
for the manufacture of ‘genuine’ Havanas. To
those, however, who cannot afford to buy the
best brands, it is satisfactory to know that a new
source of supply is being opened up with great
energy. The climate and soil of some parts of
Jamaica very closely resemble those of Havana,
and are well suited for the growth of the finest
leaf. As the Jamaica planters open up their
virgin soil, it is safe to predict that with growing
experience they will improve in their manufactures,
while already they produce a cigar which
compares favourably with any but the best of
Cuban make.</p>

<p>British cigars, like all other varieties, may be
good, bad, or indifferent. By British we mean
cigars manufactured in this country from the
imported leaf; and as English capital can command
the markets, there is no reason why the
best tobacco should not be obtainable for importation.
Using the same quality of leaf, a cigar
can be produced in this country at a much lower
cost than if imported ready made. We venture
to think, notwithstanding popular prejudice, that
a good British cigar is preferable to an inferior
foreign make. Pay a fair price, and you will get a
good article—home made, in spite of the Spanish
labels, which are always used either from affectation
or in order to deceive the ignorant. Much
is heard about adulteration by means of cabbage-leaves,
&amp;c.; but we believe that it is almost
unknown in this country. The fact that inferior
tobaccos are so very cheap makes fraud both
unlikely and unnecessary. Adulteration, however,
is not unknown on the continent, where
cigars can be obtained six and ten for a penny;
but the duty of five shillings per pound is
fortunately a bar to their importation into Great
Britain. It is needless to say more about continental
cigars than we do about all cheap
cigars, and that is to recommend smokers to avoid
them.</p>

<p>The manufacture of the finished article requires
highly skilled labour, and long practice gives the
workman an amount of accuracy and dexterity
in producing cigar after cigar, alike in shape and
size, with a rapidity that is truly wonderful.
After the leaves have been properly cured, they
are sorted according to size and colour. The
centre rib is then extracted, an operation requiring
great care. Each workman is seated before
a flat board, and is supplied with a bunch of
perfect leaves and a pile of broken tobacco. With
his fingers, he quickly rolls up some broken pieces,
inclosing them in one of the less perfect leaves,
forming what is called ‘the bunch.’ This he
proceeds to cover with the wrapper or perfect
leaf, which he has already cut with his knife to
the required size. The most difficult part of the
process has now to be completed, namely, closing
in the point. This he does by modelling it with
his fingers, quickly twisting the wrapper round
it, and fixing the end with a drop of gum. With
one sweep of his knife—his only implement—he
trims the broad end, and the cigar is ready to
be carried to the drying-room, afterwards to be
sorted and packed in boxes.</p>

<p>It is easier to know a good cigar when you
smoke one than to describe the points by which
a good cigar may be selected. A good cigar,
however, should have a good wrapper or exterior;
it should have a faint gloss, not amounting to
greasiness, due to the essential oil contained in
it; and it should have a fine hairy ‘down’ on
its surface. In addition to this, it should be
firmly rolled, and yet not be hard, or it will
not draw well. When lighted it should burn
evenly, and not to one side; it should carry a
two-inch ash without endangering your coat, and
if laid aside for three or four minutes, should
still be alight when taken up again. It is worth
remembering the golden rule known to the lovers
of the fragrant weed, namely, when holding a
lighted cigar, always to keep the burning end
turned upwards, so that the smoke may escape
into the air—never downwards, as that causes
the smoke to pass through the body of the cigar.</p>

<p>In concluding these brief remarks, it may not
be amiss to say a word or two about the markings
which will be found on the boxes, and about
which a good deal of ignorance exists. On
most boxes there are four distinct markings,
which have each their own significance. First
comes the brand proper, which consists either
of the maker’s name or of some fancy name
adopted by the firm; such, for example, as
Partagas, Villar y Villar, Intimidads, Henry
Clays, &amp;c. The quality of the tobacco is next
indicated by Flor Fina, first quality; Flor,
second quality, &amp;c. Various names, such as
Infantes, Reinas, Imperiales, &amp;c., are used to
represent the size or shape of the cigar. The
fourth mark gives us an idea of the strength
or colour of the tobacco contained in the box;
and for this purpose the following terms are
used—Claro, Colorado claro, Maduro, &amp;c. To
attempt to give any advice to our readers as to
the best brands to buy would be beyond the
scope of this paper. Experience will soon teach
them what to accept and what to avoid; what
suits their tastes and their pockets, and what
does not.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Phew</span>! There’s not a breath of air in this
valley. One had need be a salamander to appreciate
a morning like this. But what a lovely
nook it is—eh, Mac? Quite worth coming half-a-dozen
miles to see.’</p>

<p>‘That it’s very pretty, I’ll not attempt to deny;
but still’——</p>

<p>‘By no means equal to what you could show
us t’other side of the Border,’ said the vicar with
a twinkle. ‘That’s understood, of course.’</p>

<p>The time was the forenoon of the day following
the evening on which Madame De Vigne had
been so startled by the sudden appearance of one
whom she had every reason to believe had died
long years before.</p>

<p>The scene was a small but romantic glen.
Over the summit of a cliff, at the upper end of a
rocky ravine, a stream, which took its rise among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_711">{711}</span>
the stern hills that shut in the background, leapt
in a cascade of feathery foam. After a fall of
some fifteen or twenty feet, it reached a broad,
shallow basin, in which it spread itself out, as
if to gather breath for its second leap, which,
however, was not quite so formidable as its first
one. After this, still babbling its own liquid
music, it fretted its way among the boulders with
which its channel was thickly strewn, and so, after
a time, left the valley behind it; and then, less
noisily, and lingering lovingly by many a quiet
pool, it gradually crept onward to the lake, in
the deep bosom of whose dark waters lay the
peace for which it seemed to have been craving
so long.</p>

<p>A steep and somewhat rugged pathway wound
up either side of the glen to the tableland at the
summit, overhung with trees and shrubs of various
kinds, with a rustic seat planted here and there
at some specially romantic point of view. Ferns,
mosses, flowers, and grasses innumerable clothed
the rocky sides of the ravine down almost to the
water’s edge. At the foot of the glen the stream
was spanned by a quaint old bridge, on which
the vicar and Dr M‘Murdo were now standing.
It was the day of the picnic of which Madame
De Vigne had made mention to Colonel Woodruffe,
and the party from the <i>Palatine</i> had driven
over in a couple of wagonettes, which, together
with the hampers containing luncheon, were
stationed in a shady spot a quarter of a mile
lower down the valley.</p>

<p>‘Look, Mac, look!’ exclaimed the vicar, ‘at
those two speckled darlings lurking there in the
shadow of the bridge. I must come and try my
luck here one of these days.’</p>

<p>‘You look just a bit feckless this morning
without your rod and basket.’</p>

<p>‘Where was the use of bringing them? No
trout worth calling a trout would rise on a
morning like this, when there’s not a cloud in
the sky as big as one’s hand, and not breeze
enough to raise a ripple on the water. I’ve
brought my hammer instead, so that I shan’t
want for amusement. Ah, Mac, what a pity it
is that you care nothing either for angling or
geology!’</p>

<p>‘I could not be fashed, as we used to say
in the North. Every man to his likes. I’ve
got a treatise in my pocket on <i>The Diaphragm
and its Functions</i>, just down from London, with
diagrams and plates. Now, if I can only find a
shady nook somewhere, I’ve no doubt that I
shall enjoy myself with my book for the next
two or three hours quite as much as you with
your rod or hammer.’</p>

<p>‘So that’s your idea of a picnic, is it?’ The
question came from Miss Gaisford, who had
come unperceived upon the two friends as they
were leaning over the parapet of the bridge.
‘To bury yourself among the trees, eh,’ she
went on, ‘and gloat over some dreadful pictures
that nobody but a doctor could look at without
shuddering? Allow me to tell you that you will
be permitted to do nothing of the kind. You will
just put your treatise in your pocket, and try
for once to make yourself sociable. Perhaps, if
you try very hard, you may even succeed in
making yourself agreeable.’</p>

<p>‘My poor Mac!’ murmured the vicar as he
settled his spectacles more firmly on his nose.</p>

<p>The doctor said nothing, but his eyes twinkled,
and he pursed up his lips.</p>

<p>‘I have arranged my plans for both of you,’
said Miss Pen with emphasis.</p>

<p>‘For both of us!’ they exclaimed simultaneously.</p>

<p>‘Yes. Lady Renshaw’——</p>

<p>‘O-h!’ It was a double groan.</p>

<p>‘Don’t interrupt. Lady Renshaw will be here
presently. As soon as she appears on the scene,
you will take charge of her. I have special
reasons for asking you to do this, which I cannot
now explain. You will amuse her, interest her,
keep her out of the way, and prevent her generally
from making a nuisance of herself to any
one but yourselves, till luncheon-time.’</p>

<p>‘My dear Pen,’ began the vicar.</p>

<p>‘My dear Miss Gaisford,’ pleaded the doctor.</p>

<p>‘You will do as you are told, and do it without
grumbling,’ was the little woman’s reply as
she shook a finger in both their faces. ‘I’ve
arranged my plans for the day, and I can’t have
them interfered with.’</p>

<p>‘My dear Pen,’ again persisted the vicar, in
his mildest tones, ‘that your plan is a perfectly
admirable one, I do not for one moment doubt,
only, as you know very well, I am not and never
have been a ladies’ man, and that in the company
of your charming sex I’m just as shy at fifty-five
as I was at eighteen. But with Mac here
the case is altogether different. All doctors know
how to please and flatter the sex—it’s part of
their stock-in-trade, so that Mac would be quite
at home with her ladyship; whereas I—well,
the fact is I had made up my mind to walk
as far as’——</p>

<p>‘Blackstone Hollow,’ interrupted his sister,
‘in order that you might have another look at
that big trout about which you dream every
night, but which you will never succeed in
catching as long as you live.’</p>

<p>‘The traitor! eh, Miss Penelope?’ cried the
doctor. ‘This is neither more nor less than
prevarication—yes, sir, prevarication—there’s no
other word for it—and you the vicar of a parish,
whose example ought to be a shining light to
all men! Septimus Gaisford, I’m ashamed of
you! As for Lady Renshaw’—— He ended
with a snap of his fingers.</p>

<p>‘Neither of you is afraid of her. Of course
not,’ remarked Miss Penelope. ‘You would scorn
to acknowledge that you are afraid of any woman.
But why run any risk in the matter? Why
allow her ladyship to attack you separately, when,
by keeping together and combining your forces,
you would render your position impregnable?’</p>

<p>‘Impregnable!’ both the gentlemen gasped
out.</p>

<p>Miss Gaisford’s merry laugh ran up the glen.
‘What a pair of delicious, elderly nincompoops
you are!’ she cried. ‘Septimus, you dear old
simpleton, haven’t you discovered that this woman
would like nothing better than to bring you to
your knees with an offer of marriage?’</p>

<p>‘Good gracious, Pen!’ cried the vicar with
a start that nearly shook the spectacles off his
nose.</p>

<p>‘Doctor, did you not see enough of her ladyship’s
tactics last evening to understand that her
plan with you is to induce you to believe that
she has fallen in love with you? and when one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_712">{712}</span>
of your sex gets the idea into his head that one
of our sex is in love with him, why, then,
a little reciprocity of sentiment is the almost
inevitable result.’</p>

<p>‘The hussy!’ exclaimed Mac. ‘I should like
her to be laid up for a fortnight and let me
have the physicking of her!’</p>

<p>‘I noticed that she did press my arm rather
more than seemed needful, when we were walking
last evening by the lake,’ remarked the
vicar.</p>

<p>‘And I remember now that she squeezed my
hand in a way that seemed to me quite unnecessary,
when she bade me good-night on the steps
of the hotel.’</p>

<p>‘Gentlemen, let there be no jealousy between
you, I beg,’ said Miss Pen with mock-solemnity.
‘If you decline to combine your forces, then
make up your minds which of you is to have
her ladyship, and let the other one go and
bewail his sorrows to the moon.’</p>

<p>‘By the way, who <i>is</i> Lady Renshaw?’ asked
the vicar. ‘I never had the pleasure of hearing
her name till yesterday.’</p>

<p>‘Her ladyship is the widow of an alderman
and ex-sheriff of London, who was knighted on
the occasion of some great event in the City.
Her husband, who was much older than herself,
left her very well off when he died. That pretty
girl, her niece, who travels about with her, has
no fortune of her own, and one of her ladyship’s
chief objects in life would seem to be to find a
rich husband for her. At the same time, from
what I have already seen of her, it appears to
me that Lady Renshaw herself would by no
means object to enter the matrimonial state again,
could she only find a husband to suit her
views.’</p>

<p>‘A dangerous woman evidently. We must
beware of her, Mac,’ said the vicar.</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head. ‘My dear friend,
your caution doesn’t apply to me,’ he said. ‘Lady
Renshaw is just one of those women that I would
not think of making my wife, if she was worth
her weight in gold.’</p>

<p>They had begun to stroll slowly forward during
the last minute or two, and leaving the bridge
behind them, were now presently lost to view
down one of the many wooded paths which
intersected the valley in every direction.</p>

<p>But a few minutes had passed, when Lady
Renshaw and Miss Wynter appeared, advancing
slowly in the opposite direction. They halted
on the bridge as the others had done before them.</p>

<p>‘What a sweetly pretty place!’ exclaimed Miss
Wynter. ‘I had no idea it would be half so
lovely. I could wander about here for a week,’
adding under her breath, ‘especially if I had
Dick to keep me company.’</p>

<p>‘Pooh! my dear; you will have had quite
enough of it by luncheon-time,’ responded her
aunt, who had seated herself on the low coping
of the bridge with her back to the view up the
glen.</p>

<p>‘I always thought you were an admirer of
pretty scenery, aunt.’</p>

<p>‘So I am—when in society. But now that
we are alone, there’s no need to go into ecstasies
about it. On a broiling day like this, I would
exchange all the scenery of the Lakes for an
easy-chair in the veranda, a nice novel, and
the music of a band in the distance.’ Then, as
if suddenly remembering something, she gazed
around and said: ‘By-the-bye, what has become
of Mr Golightly?’</p>

<p>‘I saw him strolling in this direction a few
minutes ago,’ was the innocent answer. ‘I have
no doubt that he is somewhere about.’</p>

<p>‘Now that Archie Ridsdale has been called
away, you will be able to give him the whole
of your attention. There seem plenty of quiet
nooks about where you will be able to get him
for a time all to yourself. He certainly seems
excessively infatuated, considering how short a
time he has known you, and I should not be a
bit surprised if that waterfall were to lead him
on to make violent love to you before you are
six hours older.’</p>

<p>‘Aunt!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, my dear, I’ve known stranger things
than that happen. When a susceptible young
man and a pretty girl sit and watch a waterfall
together, he is almost sure before long to begin
squeezing her hand, and then what follows is
simply a question of diplomacy on her part.’</p>

<p>‘If—if—in the course of a few days—Mr
Golightly were to propose?’——</p>

<p>‘He may do it this very day for aught one
can tell. He seems infatuated enough for any
thing. When he does propose, you will accept
him—conditionally. You will take care to let
him see that you care for him—a little. You
have known him for so short a time that really
you scarcely know your own feelings—&amp;c., &amp;c.
Of course, before finally making up your mind,
we must have some more definite information
as to the position and prospects of the young
man, and what his father the bishop has in view
as regards his future. Besides, Mr Archie Ridsdale
may possibly be back in the course of a day
or two.’</p>

<p>‘But in what way can Archie’s return affect
me?’</p>

<p>‘You stupid girl! have I not already told you
that Sir William is nearly sure to refuse his
consent, and that Archie’s engagement with this
Miss Loraine may be broken off at any moment.
Then will come your opportunity. Archie
seemed very fond of you at one time, and there’s
no reason why he should not become fond of
you again. Young men’s fancies are as changeable
as the wind, as you ought to know quite
well by this time.’</p>

<p>Bella only shrugged her shoulders and sauntered
slowly over the bridge.</p>

<p>The expression of Lady Renshaw’s face changed
the moment she found herself alone, and her
thoughts reverted to a topic over which they
had busied themselves earlier in the day.</p>

<p>‘So this high and mighty Madame De Vigne—this
person whom nobody seems to know anything
about—could not condescend to come in
the same wagonette with us poor mortals! She
and her sister must follow in a carriage by themselves,
forsooth! Last evening, when we got
back from the lake, she had retired for the
night; this morning, she breakfasted in her own
room. I feel more convinced than ever that
there’s some mystery about her. If I could
but find out what it is! Of course, in such a
case it would become my duty at once to communicate
with Sir William.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_713">{713}</span></p>

<p>Miss Wynter came back over the bridge, but
much more quickly than she had gone. ‘Oh,
look, aunt!’ she exclaimed; ‘I declare there’s
D—— I mean Mr Golightly, standing yonder,
gazing at the water, and all alone.’</p>

<p>Lady Renshaw took a survey of the young
man through her glasses. Feeling safe in his
disguise, Richard had now discarded some portions
of the clerical-looking costume he had worn
yesterday, and was attired this morning more
after the style of an ordinary tourist.</p>

<p>‘You had better stroll gently along in the
same direction,’ remarked her ladyship. ‘Poor
young man, he looks very lonely!’</p>

<p>‘But I can’t leave you alone, aunt.’</p>

<p>‘Never mind about me. Besides, I see that
dear vicar and Dr M‘Murdo coming this way.’</p>

<p>Lady Renshaw turned to greet Miss Gaisford
and the two gentlemen, who were still a little
distance off.</p>

<p>‘Here they come. To which of my two
admirers shall I devote myself to-day?’ she
simpered. ‘Why not endeavour to play one off
against the other, and so excite a little jealousy?
It is so nice to make the men jealous. Poor
dear Sir Timothy never would be jealous; but
then he was so very stupid!’</p>

<p>Miss Gaisford was the first to speak. ‘We
were just wondering what had become of you,
Lady Renshaw.’</p>

<p>‘I lingered here to drink in this fairy scene.
It is indeed too, too exquisitely beautiful.’</p>

<p>‘If they would only turn on a little more
water at the top of the cliff it would be an
improvement,’ answered Miss Pen.—‘Septimus,
you might inquire whether they can’t arrange it
specially for us to-day.’</p>

<p>‘My dear!’ protested the vicar with mild-eyed
amazement.</p>

<p>‘Maybe, like myself,’ remarked the doctor,
‘your ladyship is a worshipper of beautiful
scenery?’</p>

<p>‘O yes. I dote on it—I revel in it. After I
lost poor dear Sir Timothy, I went to Switzerland,
in the hope of being able to distract my mind
by travel. Those darling Alps, I shall always
feel grateful to them!’</p>

<p>‘What did the Alps do for you, Lady Renshaw?’
queried Miss Pen with the utmost gravity.</p>

<p>‘They gave me back my peace of mind; they
poured consolation into my lacerated heart.’</p>

<p>‘Very kind of them—very kind indeed,’
answered Miss Pen drily.</p>

<p>Lady Renshaw threw a quick, suspicious glance
at her. ‘What a very strange person!’ she
murmured. The vicar’s sister was a puzzle to
her. It could not be that she was covertly
making fun of her, Lady Renshaw! No; the
idea was too preposterous.</p>

<p>Dr Mac had not gone about for fifty years
with his eyes shut. He had discovered that
many persons, both male and female, who plume
themselves on their knowledge of the world and
their shrewdness in dealing with the common
affairs of life, are yet as susceptible to flattery,
even of the most fulsome kind, and just as liable
to be led away by it into the regions of foolishness,
as their far less sophisticated fellow-mortals.
What if this woman, with all her worldly-mindedness
and calculating selfishness, were one
of those individuals who may be dexterously led
by the nose and persuaded to dance to any tune
so long as their ears are judiciously tickled?
A peculiar gleam came into the doctor’s eyes
as these thoughts passed through his mind. He
cleared his voice and turned to her ladyship.</p>

<p>‘It appears to me, Lady Renshaw,’ he began,
‘speaking from a professional point of view, that
you are gifted with one of those highly-strung,
super-sensitive, and poetical organisations which
render those who possess them peculiarly susceptible
to all beautiful influences whether of
nature or of art. Hem.’</p>

<p>‘How thoroughly you understand me, Dr
M‘Murdo!’ responded her ladyship, beaming on
him with one of her broadest smiles.</p>

<p>The vicar took off his spectacles and proceeded
to rub them vigorously with his handkerchief.
‘Mac, you are nothing better than a barefaced
humbug,’ he whispered to himself.</p>

<p>‘It would seem only natural, my dear madam,’
resumed the unblushing doctor, ‘that a temperament
such as yours, which throbs responsive to
beauty in all its thousand varied forms as readily
as an Æolian harp responds to the faintest sigh
of the summer breeze, should—should find an
outlet for itself in one form or other. Have
you never, may I ask, attempted to pour out
your thick crowding fancies in verse? Have you
never, while gazing on some such scene as this,
felt as if you could float away on—on the wings
of Poesy? Have you never, in brief, felt as if
you could only find relief by rushing into song?
Hem.’</p>

<p>The poor vicar fairly gasped for breath.</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes; that is exactly how I have felt a
thousand times,’ gushed her ladyship. ‘At such
moments I seem to exhale poetry.’</p>

<p>‘Dear me! rather a remarkable phenomenon,’
murmured Miss Pen.</p>

<p>‘I long to be a dryad—or a nymph—or one of
Dian’s huntresses in some Arcadian grove of old.’</p>

<p>‘A nymph! Hum,’ remarked the vicar softly
to himself.</p>

<p>‘But I have never yet ventured to—to’——</p>

<p>‘Gush into song,’ suggested Miss Pen.</p>

<p>‘To attempt to clothe my thoughts in rhythmic
measures,’ went on her ladyship with a little
wave of the hand, as though deprecating interruption,
‘although I have often felt an inward voice
which impelled me to do so.’</p>

<p>‘Let me advise you to try, my dear madam,’
resumed the doctor with his gravest professional
air. ‘If I may be allowed to say so, you have
the eye of a poet—dreamy, imaginative, with
a sort of far-away gaze in it, as though you
were looking at something a long way off which
nobody but yourself could see.’</p>

<p>‘Ought I to listen to these things in silence?’
asked the vicar of himself with a sudden qualm
of conscience.</p>

<p>‘You are a great, naughty flatterer, Dr
M‘Murdo,’ said the widow, shaking a podgy finger
archly at him.</p>

<p>‘Madam, that is one of the points on which
my education has been shamefully neglected.’</p>

<p>She turned with a smile. ‘I trust that our
dear vicar is also a worshipper of the beautiful?’</p>

<p>‘With Lady Renshaw before my eyes, it would
be rank heresy to doubt it,’ stammered the dear
old boy with a blush that would have become
a lad of eighteen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_714">{714}</span></p>

<p>‘Pass up one, Septimus,’ whispered his sister
in his ear.</p>

<p>‘If you talk to me in that strain, I shall begin
to think you a very, very dangerous man,’ simpered
her ladyship.</p>

<p>‘There’s a charming view of the lake from an
opening in the trees a little farther on,’ remarked
Dr Mac. ‘Would not your ladyship like to walk
as far?’</p>

<p>‘By all means, though I am loath to tear
myself from this exquisite spot.’</p>

<p>‘We shall find our way back to it later on.’</p>

<p>‘With your permission, I will leave you good
people for a little while,’ remarked Miss Pen.
‘I’ve other fish to fry.’</p>

<p>Her ladyship stared. ‘What an excessively
vulgar remark!’ was her unspoken thought.</p>

<p>Miss Gaisford turned to her. ‘Lady Renshaw,
I must intrust these two young sparks into your
hands for a time.’</p>

<p>‘You could not leave us in more charming
captivity,’ remarked the gallant doctor.</p>

<p>The vicar, as he fingered the hammer in his
pocket, looked imploringly at his sister, but she
pretended not to see.</p>

<p>‘Au revoir, then, dear Miss Gaisford,’ said her
ladyship in her most affable tones.</p>

<p>‘Au revoir, au revoir.’</p>

<p>As the three went sauntering away, the vicar
lagging a little behind the others, Miss Pen
heard the doctor say: ‘You know the song,
Lady Renshaw, <i>When I view those Scenes so
charming</i>,’ after which nothing but a murmur
reached her ears.</p>

<p>She turned away with a little laugh. ‘The
doctor will fool her to the top of her bent. Who
would have thought that high-dried piece of
buckram had so much quiet fun in him?—And
now to look after my hampers. If I trust to
the servants, by luncheon-time the ice, like
Niobe, will have wept itself away, the corkscrew
will have taken a ramble on its own account,
the vinegar and salt will have gone into housekeeping
together, and the mustard will be
making love to the blanc-mange. My reputation
is at stake.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AMERICAN_NEWSPAPERS_ON_THEMSELVES">AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS ON THEMSELVES.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been fairly proved in previous numbers
of this <i>Journal</i> that so long as advertising continues,
a newspaper can rarely be altogether dull,
for the curiosities of the advertisement columns
often exhibit strange freaks and fancies of human
nature, which may afford amusement when the
news columns are at their grimmest and dreariest.
But the place of all others which may be regarded
as the headquarters of the advertising genius
is the land across the Atlantic, and the papers
which are the medium of the greatest enterprise
in this line are the <i>Tribunes</i> and <i>Suns</i>
of the United States; and most entertaining
of all are the announcements by which the
American journals draw attention to their own
brilliant pages. An English newspaper directory
is not very attractive, except to the business
portion of the community; but an American
publication of the kind is of a much more
amusing character; and in two bulky and comprehensive
volumes, an indomitable transatlantic
publisher has issued a universal gazetteer, wherein
the newspapers of every part of the globe may
be studied.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is enough for an English
paper, as a rule, to state the town and county
it represents; but young America must do
more than this, if readers outside her various
regions are to estimate the value of her press.
Jacksonville or Euteroga must be set forth
as indisputably the most thriving city in the
richest district of the most prosperous State.
Magnolia, advertisers are ‘notified,’ is a ‘flourishing
town with more than twenty-five business-houses;’
Augusta ‘is growing and has a bright
future;’ Westfield is ‘a thriving town of above
a thousand inhabitants,’ clearly affording scope for
a large circulation.</p>

<p>Manchester (United States), we learn, in a
sentence racy of the soil, ‘is a large, live, and
growing city, makes one hundred and seventy-nine
miles of cloth per day, can build fifteen
locomotives a month, and fifty steam fire-engines
a year, and an endless variety of other products
of skill and industry.’ Another rising spot has
‘fourteen grocery, three hardware, and five dry
goods stores, four tailor-shops, six butcher-shops,
two banks, four hotels, three grist-mills, two
stave-factories, foundry, planing-mills, &amp;c., and
six churches, one of which cost about sixteen
thousand dollars, and has a spire one hundred
and forty-eight feet high.’ But this edifice is
outdone in a third town which ‘points with
just pride to its magnificent iron bridge, costing
over forty thousand dollars, and other evidences
of public enterprise.’ Middle Loup Valley is,
we are told, ‘one of the largest and most productive
valleys in the State, which is from its
picturesque scenery and fertility of soil poetically
called the “Rhine of America.”’ Another touch
of poetry is come across unexpectedly: ‘A belt
of fire from thousands of coke ovens surrounds
Mount Pleasant, the centre of the great Connellsville
Coke County, and the place where the
<i>Times and Mining Journal</i> is published;’ and
there is a rhythmical swing about the remark
that the <i>Honey Grove Independent</i> ‘is published
in the land where cotton grows rank and tall,
and where cattle grow fat in the wild prairies.’
But Honey Grove with its cattle is nothing to
Hancock County, where ‘the people have become
so corpulent, that the druggists are all becoming
independently rich from the sale of Allen’s Anti-Fat;’
and the Blue Grass Valley of Kentucky
‘is famous all over the world for its handsome
women, thoroughbred horses, rich soil, and fine
climate.’</p>

<p>To be worthy of a land like this, the newspapers
also possess rare attractions for readers
and advertisers, the latter especially. They are
‘alive and growing’ ‘newsy! pithy! spicy!’
one is a ‘paper for all mankind,’ another ‘overflows
with local gossip,’ and a third ‘discusses
public questions with lively respectability, and
feeds its readers with no less than four and often
five columns of spicy local matter each week;’
a fourth has ‘everything first-class;’ you can get
‘a bright and newsy wide-awake local paper,’ or
‘a live thirty-two column weekly;’ and the
<i>Eaton Rapids Journal</i> will be found, appropriately
to its name, ‘a live paper in a live town.’ Yet
more richly descriptive is the account of the ‘red-hot
local paper that feeds twenty thousand people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_715">{715}</span>
every week and makes them fat; advertisements
can reach millions of hungry minds through this
medium.’ Again, we learn that ‘Life on the
ocean wave is nothing compared with reading
the <i>Plymouth Pantograph</i>.’ The <i>Sacramento Bee</i>
is ‘the spiciest, ablest, most brilliant, and most
independent journal published on the Pacific
coast;’ while for ‘talking large,’ honourable
mention should also be accorded to one of Cincinnati’s
lights, which is ‘the best paper ever
published. All its news is first-hand from upwards
of fifteen hundred reporters and correspondents
in every part of the United States
and Europe.’</p>

<p>But these are mere outward characteristics and
generalisations. Politics denote more distinctly
the paper’s line of action, whether ‘stalwart
Republican,’ ‘sound Democratic,’ or ‘Independent
in all things, neutral in nothing.’ Independence
is the cry of many; they are ‘bold and fearless,’
express a hatred of party, rings and ringsters.
‘Now in its third volume,’ exults one banner of
freedom, ‘and has never halted by the way nor
wearied of the fight. Always ready to take up
the cause of the poor and oppressed, and never
ready to surrender its independence to party,
clique, or ring.’ ‘Has no axe to grind other than
the advancement of every social reform,’ a second
patriot proclaims. ‘Therefore it hits a head
whenever that head is seen in opposition to true
advancement.’ For the extremes of party violence
we must go to a Southern journal, which does
not, it may well be hoped, ‘speak as the masses
of our people feel and talk;’ if it does, so much
the worse for the people. ‘If the Yankees,’ this
rodomontade begins, ‘want to know the real
sentiments of our people; if they want to have
a realising sense of the utter madness of trying
to govern the grand old sovereign States of the
Confederacy, they will close their ears to the
lying professions of our policy-bumming politicians
and subscribe to the <i>Bartlett News</i>.’ Perhaps
some such rant as that of the <i>Bartlett News</i>
a certain <i>Labor Standard</i> had in view while
stating itself to be ‘not a blowing, blustering,
black-mail sheet which has to be read in private
because its contents are unfit to be seen in the
family,’ but ‘a clean live weekly paper, devoted
entirely to the interests of the working-classes.’</p>

<p>A Texan organ ‘will seek to be a photograph
of all the resources and needs of Texas; a
mirror of her markets; a barometer of pure
principles, sound public faith, and private honour.
Democratic, but conservative, independent and
outspoken in the exalted interests of just criticism—no
panderer to partisan men or measures,
whether right or wrong!’ This is independence
with a vengeance, ahead even of the
gazette which ‘favours immigration, morality,
and the Christian religion; and unflinchingly
opposes shams, rings, rogues, and enemies to the
people. It exposes villainy and crime wherever
found, and hence is read by the more intelligent
classes of people in the field where it
circulates.’</p>

<p>The conjunction of immigration and the Christian
religion reminds one of the much bemourned
lady who ‘painted in water-colours and of such
is the kingdom of heaven.’ But there is a still
more frank linking together of things temporal
and spiritual in the ‘only Democratic out-and-out
paper in Western Iowa,’ which sails under the
motto, more Yankee than reverent, ‘Fear God,
tell the truth, and make money;’ the editor
further announcing that if he ‘is allowed to live
under a Republican administration another year,
he will carry your advertising at five cents per
line, fifty dollars per column, or furnish his paper
for one dollar fifty cents per year.’</p>

<p>The <i>Horseheads Journal and Chemung Co.
Greenback</i> ‘exposes rascality everywhere, and
aims to give something to interest and instruct
everybody every week,’ from which it may be
surmised that the <i>Horseheads Journal and Chemung
Co. Greenback</i> is happier in its object than
in its title. Many of these ‘wide-awake and
spicy’ representatives of Western culture are not
remarkable for the elegance of their names, the
admixture of Indian and American resulting in
some curious compounds, such as the <i>Petrolea
Topic</i>, the <i>Klickitat Sentinel</i>, the <i>Katahdin Kalendar</i>,
the <i>Waxahachie Enterprise</i>, and the <i>Coshocton Age</i>.
Yankee, pure and simple, reigns in the <i>Weekly
Blade</i>, <i>Jacksonian</i>, <i>Biggsville Clipper</i>, <i>People’s Telephone</i>,
and <i>New Haven Palladium</i>; but there is
a charm of euphony about the <i>Xenia Sunlight</i>
and <i>Golden Globe</i>, and the brevity which may
be the soul of wit in the <i>Call</i>, <i>Item</i>, <i>Plaindealer</i>,
and <i>Editor’s Eye</i>.</p>

<p>The editors, as is well known, come much
more to the front than is the case in England;
they do not remain the invisible and mysterious
‘we’ of the editorial sanctum; their names
are frequently advertised with those of the publishers,
occasionally, indeed, accompanied by a
portrait or other additional recommendation;
one paper ‘is edited by two of the ablest newspaper
men in the State, and it will be hard
to find a better team in the editorial harness.’
‘The most important feature,’ we learn, ‘of the
<i>Free Press</i> is its funny squibs by the editor,
“Driftings from Dreamland,” which are original
and spicy;’ and as appropriately named, surely,
is ‘a humorous department, “Tea and Toast,”’
to be found in another print. A Texas editor
offers ‘upon justifiable encouragement to visit
any county or city in Texas or Mexico and make
a statistical “write-up” of their every interest
and advantage,’ indicative of lively and reliable
information for intending immigrants; and a
<i>Highland Recorder</i>, with an affection for the Land
o’ Cakes one can but sympathise with, says that
‘every page breathes of Clan-Alpine freshness.’</p>

<p>Great stress is laid upon the home-printing
of the small journals—‘no patent outside or
inside;’ ‘almost every sentence is of home manufacture,
little clipping is done;’ ‘the only paper
that does all its work at home,’ &amp;c. A further
noticeable feature is the frequent use of certificates
and testimonials as to circulation from
public and private individuals or from contemporary
prints, or of self-recommendations such as
that of the paper which ‘has a very fine list of
country subscribers,’ or of the journal ‘published
by a genuine Jayhawker,’ which ‘goes to every
post-office in the northern part of the State.’</p>

<p>It is when we come to the direct announcements
to advertisers, however, that we get perhaps
the queerest hints from our American cousins.
‘Advertising rates cheerfully furnished’ appears
frequently; ‘Advertisers love it’ is a short and
sweet statement regarding one paper; ‘Should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_716">{716}</span>
patronised by every live advertiser;’ ‘Advertisers,
do you want some return for your money? Read
our inducements,’ say others. Then, ‘The modesty
of the publishers deters them from mentioning
the peculiar merits of the <i>Courier</i> as an advertising
medium’—a modesty rivalled by the
remark, ‘Rates of advertising so low that we
are almost ashamed to announce them,’ which
differs from the standpoint of a third, ‘Advertising
rates held high enough to make a living
for the publisher;’ and the latter appears upon
the whole to be the more general sentiment, as
may be testified by ‘Don’t send offers under price,’
‘We only advertise <i>for money</i>.’ The last sentence
alludes to a species of exchange evidently less
popular among the publishers than with their
clients. ‘No advertising solicited,’ says the
<i>Westfield Pantograph</i>, ‘except for cash, or what
may be as good. No space to give away or let
at half-price.’ More decisive is the <i>Calhoun Pilot</i>,
which ‘is choice in the admission of advertisements
in its columns, and those it does admit,
“due bills” of no character will settle for them.
Must be in hard cash quarterly in advance, unless
good references are given. Save your paper and
postage, ye advertisers who have nothing to offer
us for our space than your wares and due bills.
We don’t want ’em. We have a good article to
retail, and nothing but the almighty dollar will
buy it. But,’ adds the <i>Pilot</i> more amiably, ‘while
this is strictly our rule, our rates are low, and
we give value received for all the lucre you
place in our possession.’ Still more downright
is the declaration, ‘No three-cornered patent
pills, second-hand clothing, skunk-hunting machines,
or hand-organs taken in payment for
advertising.’ ‘The <i>News</i> publishes no dead ads.,
and gives no puffs;’ ‘No half-cash advertisements
accepted, no swindling or bogus patrons wanted.’
‘Dead-beat, swindling advertisers,’ sarcastically
announces the <i>Troy Free Press</i>, ‘can have their
matter chucked carefully into the stove by sending
them to our office. Our space is for sale,
and must be paid for at living rates.’ But there
is encouragement for honest advertisers given
by a <i>Clipper-Herald</i> through whose columns
announcements ‘go to that class of people who
are honest and intelligent and who pay for what
they get;’ and in an equally straightforward
assertion elsewhere, the <i>mens conscia recti</i> of the
editor rises superior to grammar into the realms
of wit: ‘Has a good circulation among a prompt-paying
class of people—these be facts!’</p>

<p>Facts or not, there is a distinctive character
about Jonathan’s advertisements equal to some
of the fiction with which he has supplied us.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.—THE EVENTS OF A NIGHT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Down-stairs</span> in the public room, the faithful
Derrick is engaged in a seemingly interesting
conversation with mine host Hobb Dipping and
two or three other jolly good fellows, who are
all drinking at his expense. No sign yet had
the attendant discovered that had served to
arouse his suspicions. No word had been spoken
which in any way showed that the natives of
this desolate place were anxious to know more
about his master or himself. A suspicion of
danger often arouses our fears and doubts
when there is perhaps the smallest occasion for
either. The honest countrymen troubled themselves
much less about the matter than even the
worthy host, who was happily indifferent to
everything but the fact that Mr Morton and
his servant were rare and profitable customers.
The lumbering knot of labourers at length departs,
and mine host locks and bars the door; while
Derrick, not a little fatigued with the harassing
events of the day, is left standing alone,
surveying a row of empty benches which the
retiring fenmen have just quitted. Burly Hobb
comes back puffing and blowing, his red face
glowing like the setting sun, and his bald
skull spotted with perspiration through the
exertion he has undergone in securing the
strongly built outer door.</p>

<p>‘Landlord, I’m going to bed,’ says Derrick,
who has suddenly returned to his original
gruffness.</p>

<p>‘Very good, sir,’ is the reply of the host, who
forthwith trims and lights an atom of a lamp
which he fishes out of a cupboard by the fireplace.
‘I hope you will sleep well, sir.’</p>

<p>Derrick’s eyes are watching the innkeeper
from under his beetling brows, and he answers
gruffly: ‘I hope so.’</p>

<p>‘I’ve heard it said,’ goes on the loquacious
host, ‘that a good sleep is worth a fortune to an
over-tired man. I see nothing to prevent you
sleeping well here, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Not much likelihood of being roused in the
night, eh?’ remarks the attendant.</p>

<p>‘Why, no, sir,’ answers Dipping, wondering
what motive his guest could have in asking such
a question. ‘There’s no one to disturb you
here, unless, indeed, it be your master himself.’</p>

<p>‘Many visitors here?’ inquired Derrick, as old
Hobb leads the way up the dusky, creaking
staircase with the flickering lamp in his hand.</p>

<p>‘None at all, sir,’ replied the landlord in a
melancholy tone. ‘There never is any one here—leastways,
very, very seldom. I haven’t had
a visitor stopping in this house for a matter
of—I can’t rightly say how long; but I know
it’s a mortal long while, for since my poor
wife died’——</p>

<p>‘Is this my room?’ interrupts Derrick, as
the innkeeper halts before a solid-looking black
door at the head of the staircase.</p>

<p>‘It is,’ answers old Dipping. ‘You are pretty
close to your master, sir.’</p>

<p>‘I know,’ is all that the attendant deigns to
say, as he pushes open the door and enters
with the light, leaving the landlord to stumble
down-stairs in the dark as best he may. Having
carefully fastened the door, Derrick sets down
the light, and approaches the window with the
intention of getting a breath of fresh air. The
casement is somewhat hard to unfasten, and when
at length he succeeds in opening it, the lamp
which he has brought is blown out under the
sudden influence of a gust of air which is
admitted. No matter; he does not want it. The
night-breeze is cool and refreshing, a favourable
contrast to the hot stifling room below, and
Derrick, as he leans upon the window-ledge,
begins to appear more contented and at ease.
All afterglow of the twilight has long disappeared,
and the moon is shining with a
sickly light upon a low layer of mist which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_717">{717}</span>
covers the marshy flats. Above the thin watery
fog which has arisen from the sluggish stream
and enshrouded the village as in a winding-sheet,
the great shattered tower of the monastery
rises ghostlike and dim, while the silence of
the vast solitude is unbroken by a single sound.
Even Derrick is not insensible to the peculiar
beauty and stillness of the scene, and he lounges
there, humming a tune, and watching the
silvery trickle upon the watery marsh long
after mine host has retired to rest. At length
he closes the casement and divests himself
of his heavy boots. Tired as he is, he does
not attempt to remove his clothes. The man
had seen a deal of sharp service, and experience
had taught him long ago that in cases
where he might be wanted at any moment, it
were better to sleep in them. He merely places
his pistols within reach, and then throwing
himself upon the bed, endeavours to sleep.</p>

<p>Every one knows what it is to arrive at that
dreamy state of semi-unconsciousness when the
weary senses, failing at once to engage the attentions
of the drowsy god, find a sort of relief in
a long train of most disconnected thought. It
was thus with Derrick. The fatigues of the
day had proved too much for even that hardy
individual, so that, instead of falling at once
into a sound refreshing sleep, he was drowsily
conning over the different events which had
occurred, his rambling imagination colouring
them with a variety of indistinct pictures and
incidents. These weird fancies at length grew
fainter and fainter, and the attendant was fast
sinking into slumber, when suddenly, and as it
seemed without a cause, he awoke. Through
the casement the moon was staring down upon
him like a pale still face, and the greater part
of his recumbent person lay bathed in its cold
light. All was still; there seemed not the
slightest reason why he should be thus aroused.
The silence was profound, and the very beating
of Derrick’s heart sounded like a hammer thumping
time in his head. Scarcely knowing what
he does, he sits up on the edge of his bed and
listens. Yes; he was not mistaken, there seemed
to be a faint noise approaching the old inn—a
low measured tramp. The hammer-like beating
grows louder as Derrick, with every nerve
strained to the utmost pitch, silently rises and
once more opens the casement. There can be no
mistake now; some persons are approaching; and
in that low tramp, distant as it is, he recognises
the marching of a body of soldiers. He closes the
window softly, and taking his heavy riding-boots
in his hand, unfastens the door, and glides softly
along the gallery towards his master’s apartment.
Owing to the pitchy darkness in which the
gallery is enveloped, he experiences some difficulty
in groping his way without stumbling;
but reaching the further end at last, he feels
his way to his master’s door and gives the
required signal. It is answered with unexpected
suddenness, the door being instantly thrown open,
and Sir Carnaby appearing on the threshold.
He is fully dressed, like Derrick; he has not
even removed his outer clothing, and in his hand
is a short broad-bladed knife. The saddle-bags
lie upon the table, and a portion of their contents,
discernible by a dim night-light, is scattered
about; but the black box is gone.</p>

<p>In a very few words, the trusty henchman
explains what is the reason of his coming, and
urges his master to hold himself in readiness to
escape, should it be necessary. Sir Carnaby looks
at him while he speaks as if he does not quite
understand his hurried explanation; but when
the attendant has finished, he looks around the
room with an anxious air, and then says:
‘If it be so, Derrick, we must get off somehow
as quickly as we can. This window, I think,
looks towards the back of the house. Can you
not manage to descend into the courtyard and
get out our horses? Lead them down the bank
of the stream towards that tall beacon by the
dike. You must remember the place; we
remarked it as we passed the mill on our journey
here.’</p>

<p>‘I remember the place, Sir Carnaby; but I
am not going to make off there, and leave you
alone here.’</p>

<p>‘I shall be safe enough, I tell you, Derrick,’
said the baronet as he hastily motioned to the
attendant to go. ‘I cannot come yet; I cannot;
it is impossible.’</p>

<p>‘I will wait below, then,’ is the stubborn reply
of his servant, who is already half out of the
window.</p>

<p>‘Derrick,’ says Sir Carnaby, laying his hand
upon the attendant’s shoulder, ‘do what I tell
you. I cannot come now; and if you wait
below for me, as you say, we shall both be
discovered. More lives than our own depend
upon your obeying me at this moment. Go, as
I tell you, and wait for me by the beacon; and I
will join you as soon as I possibly can.’</p>

<p>The man clasps his master’s hand, and, with
something like tears in his eyes, makes his way
to the ground. The fugitive baronet has no
emotion expressed on his countenance, for he
fears not for himself; his thoughts are centred
upon that black box which has now so strangely
disappeared. With the broad-bladed knife still
in his hand, he goes towards a corner of the
room, kneels down, and appears to busy himself
with the planking of the floor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fortunately for himself, Derrick had found
his way to the shed where the horses had
been stabled; and his efforts to saddle and
bring them out had proved successful. The
great gates leading out of the courtyard of the
old inn were fastened; but this did not deter
the attendant’s movements for an instant. Leading
the horses through a gap in the fence at
the back of the <i>Saxonford Arms</i>, he crossed
a small cultivated inclosure, and emerged from
the cover of a hedge upon the open highway.
Stopping for a moment to listen, he plainly
distinguished the measured tramp of soldiers
approaching the inn, mingled with the low
peculiar clank of arms and accoutrements. One
circumstance which particularly alarmed Derrick
was that the sound plainly came from the direction
in which he had to go. There was no time
for thought, however; the warning tramp which
broke the stillness of the night came nearer
and nearer, and over the old timber bridge
which crossed the stream came a dim file of
figures—eleven of them. Derrick could easily
count the number as they passed over the bridge
and came straight towards the old <i>Saxonford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_718">{718}</span>
Arms</i>, their fixed bayonets flashing and glittering
in the moonlight.</p>

<p>There was but one course he could take;
he must move forward and pass them. No
opportunity for making a detour, for the military
were not one hundred yards from the house,
and the attendant knew that he had been
seen. Muttering a prayer for his master’s safety,
Derrick put the horses to a slow trot, and
advanced towards the soldiers with a feeling
of fear at his heart which he had never before
experienced. He had not covered half the distance
before a sharp word of command came
from the front, and a line was drawn up across
the road, evidently with the intention of disputing
his further progress. A dash for it now;
delay meant capture both for himself and his
master. Digging spurs into his horse’s sides,
the attendant laid the flat of his broad blade
over the flanks of Sir Carnaby’s charger which
he led, and tore down the road like a whirlwind.
It was all over in a minute. A sheet of
flame shot forth as the bold horseman broke
through the line, and then, without a check, he
found himself ascending the steep bank close
against the bridge. The soldiers, however, who
had taken the initiative, had no intention of
letting their suspected quarry escape. Before Sir
Carnaby’s servant could head the bank, he was
surrounded, and a hoarse cry to stop and surrender
came from his pursuers. In this they had mistaken
their man. Derrick entertained no such
idea. He indeed hoped that the firing would
alarm his master, and allow him time to make
his retreat in safety; but not a thought had he
of yielding. Once more clapping spurs to his
horse, and striking right and left with his drawn
blade, the attendant partially succeeded in clearing
himself from the press.</p>

<p>At this moment, a random shot from one of
the military dropped his master’s horse, which
he had been leading. Derrick had scarcely time
to disengage his arm from the bridle before the
poor animal went crashing down, breaking the
worm-eaten railing of the bridge like matchwood,
and throwing one of his assailants headlong into
the stream below. In the confusion, Derrick
received a bayonet-wound in the left arm, and
he was nearly pulled from his saddle; but
shaking himself free with almost superhuman
strength, he applied his spurs, and galloped
across the old bridge for dear life.</p>

<p>Although there appeared to be no attempt
at pursuit, Derrick did not judge it prudent
to ride straight for the spot where he hoped
to meet his master. After making a considerable
circuit, the trusty henchman, faithful to the
last, reined in his reeking steed, and gazed
across the flat misty space in the direction of
the <i>Saxonford Arms</i>. The silence, however, was
as complete as when he had sat at that open
window looking over the fen. Not a soul was
anywhere near him. Putting his horse once
more in motion, the man rode slowly along the
bank until he reached the place of rendezvous.
It was as he both feared and suspected. Sir
Carnaby was not there. He must wait. The
clear night clouded, and the hours passed by,
but yet his master came not. Derrick might wait
until the crack of doom, but he never would meet
his master again on earth. The devoted courage
of the servant was useless now, for, pierced by a
musket bullet, Sir Carnaby Vincent lay lifeless
across the stairs of the old <i>Saxonford Arms</i>.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IV.—AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS.</h3>

<p>It wanted but a few days to Christmas 1760—a
seasonable Christmas, and in keeping with that
festive season of the year. Snow and sharp
north-east winds had been plentiful for nearly
a week past. The flat country all around the
time-honoured cathedral city of Fridswold had
been covered with a vast sheet of drifted snow,
which had found its way into every nook and
crevice, filling up all the ditches and dikes
until they were level with the surrounding
country. The minster tower was embellished
with an innumerable number of white patches,
and the minster roofs were hidden under a
thick covering of frozen snow. It was evident
that King Christmas had things to his liking
this time, and was bent upon enjoying his
own particular time in his own particular way.
Meanwhile the wind roared on, roared and
whistled, and whisked the sharp frozen snowflakes
round and round, dashing them, as if in
impotent rage, against the sturdy walls of the
minster. The air was so thick that, although
the hour was not late, darkness had set in with
a density that obscured every object from view,
while the tolling of the great vespers-bell was
drowned by the distracting uproar of the elements.</p>

<p>It was during one of the uncertain lulls
which occurred from time to time, that a figure
emerged from the protecting shelter of one of
the cathedral buttresses, and wrapping himself
in the folds of a horseman’s cloak, strode hastily
forward, evidently intending to take advantage
of the brief calm and reach some haven
of shelter. Scarcely a single person was to be
seen in the deserted streets, through which the
blast tore with such mad fury that the buffeted
wayfarer staggered again. Visions of glowing
fires, dry clothes, and comfortable shelter rose
before his imagination as he passed a brightly
lighted window. But there was no stopping for
him; he must on and fight this tough battle
with the pitiless wind as best he may. His
destination is at length reached. The weather-beaten
traveller descends a couple of steps,
passes through an open doorway, and emerges
from the outer darkness into a warm, cosy-looking
bar—his clothes half-frozen, and crusted with
patches of snow. He is apparently known here,
for he is instantly relieved of his cloak and hat
by a neat-looking damsel, who up to the present
moment has been engaged in a light and refreshing
flirtation with a large, hot-visaged man
lounging before the fire.</p>

<p>‘Sharp weather this, sir,’ remarked that worthy,
slightly moving from his place.</p>

<p>‘Sharp indeed!’ returned the other in a deep
voice, as he shook some loose particles of snow
from his person.</p>

<p>‘Ah, this’ll be a bad time for many people,’
was the next remark the large man ventured
upon.</p>

<p>A muttered exclamation dropped from the lips
of the last comer, but was too indistinct to be
heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_719">{719}</span></p>

<p>‘There’ll be many a person remember this
night,’ continued he of the fiery countenance,
with an insane notion that he was getting along
capitally.</p>

<p>The individual addressed turned sharply round,
fixing a pair of dark eyes upon the other’s face,
but he did not speak.</p>

<p>Somewhat discouraged, the large man paused
for a minute ere he spoke again. The person
he seemed so wishful to converse with was a
tall, handsome, young fellow, dressed in a sort
of half-military costume, and with a bold dashing
look, sufficient in itself to attract notice. By
his side was a silver-hilted rapier, the ordinary
weapon of a gentleman of the day; and the martial
look of the wearer was sufficient proof that
he would be prompt to use it in any emergency.
Seemingly not satisfied with the long inspection
he had thought fit to take, our red-faced friend
once more endeavoured to enter into conversation;
but the gentleman, after giving the maid
some orders, quitted the room.</p>

<p>‘Is that gentleman staying in the house,
Peggy, my dear?’ asked the red-faced one of the
waiting-maid.</p>

<p>‘Yes; he came here last night,’ replied the
girl, who was perfectly ready to resume the aforesaid
flirtation, which had been interrupted by
the entrance of the visitor.</p>

<p>But the man with the fiery face now seemed
to be persistently interested in the stranger.
‘What may his name be, Peg?’ he asked in a
tone of affected carelessness.</p>

<p>‘That’s no business of yours, Mr Goff,’ retorted
the damsel a trifle tartly, for the swain’s indifference
somewhat nettled her.</p>

<p>‘Now, Peggy, my chuck, don’t get crusty,’ said
the big man in wheedling accents. ‘What’s that
you’ve got in your pretty hand?’</p>

<p>‘It’s the gentleman’s hat,’ replied the fair maid,
somewhat relaxing. ‘I’m going to dry it by
the fire with his cloak. They’re sopping wet,
now the snow’s melted on them.’</p>

<p>‘He’s not likely to lose his headpiece, whoever
he may be,’ remarked Mr Goff. ‘I can see
“R. Ainslie” on the lining quite plain, as you’re
holding it now.’</p>

<p>‘You seem to take a deal of interest in the
gentleman,’ laughed Peggy as she turned the hat
away.</p>

<p>‘It’s mighty little interest I take in any one
except you, my beauty,’ returned Mr Goff. ‘I
only thought the young fellow looked wonderful
weary and tired like.’</p>

<p>‘He looked that yesterday,’ said Peggy, warming
to the subject. ‘I felt quite sorry for him
when he rode up. It wasn’t fit weather to turn
a dog out in.’</p>

<p>‘And he’s been out again to-day?’ hazarded
the big man.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ replied Peggy, depositing the hat and
cloak in front of the roaring blaze. ‘He went
out early on foot, leaving his horse in the stable,
and we saw nothing more of him till two o’clock.
He came back then, and ordered something to
eat; but, as I’m a living creature, I think he
scarcely touched it. After that, he went out
again, and did not return till just now.’</p>

<p>‘It seems wonderful curious,’ said Mr Goff
slowly, as he buttoned up his coat and prepared
to go—‘seems wonderful curious that a young
gent should go on in that fashion. When I see
’em a-doing so, I always have a sort of notion
that they’ve got something on their minds, and
are going to act rash.’</p>

<p>‘That’s your experience, is it?’ said the girl
with a laugh. ‘I don’t think much of it.’</p>

<p>‘Possibly not,’ returned the other. ‘Good-night.’</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_SOLITARY_ISLAND">A SOLITARY ISLAND.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> government of Iceland have commissioned
Mr Thoroddsen to undertake systematic explorations
of that island, with a view to investigating
its physical features and describing its natural
history. While on a visit to Grimsey, a small
island twenty-two miles due north of Iceland, he
found it inhabited by eighty-eight human beings,
debarred from all communication with the mainland,
excepting once or twice every year, when,
at great risk, the natives contrived to visit the
mainland in their small open boats.</p>

<p>After describing the flora and meteorology of
this secluded islet, Mr Thoroddsen informs us
that the ‘pastor of the island, M. Pjetur Gudmundsson,
has for many years been engaged in
exceedingly careful meteorological observations
on behalf of the Meteorological Institute of
Copenhagen. This most worthy gentleman,
living here in conspicuous poverty, like a hermit
divorced from the world, though he has the
comfort of a good wife to be thankful for, is not
only regarded as a father by his primitive congregation,
but enjoys, moreover, the reputation of
being in the front rank among sacred poets in
modern Iceland.</p>

<p>‘The inhabitants derive their livelihood for
the most part from bird-catching, nest-robbing,
and deep-sea fisheries. The precipices that form
the eastern face of the island are crowded with
myriads of various kinds of sea-fowl. On every
ledge the birds are seen thickly packed together;
the rocks are white with guano, or green-tufted
with scurvy-grass; here everything is in ceaseless
movement, stir, and flutter, accompanied by a
myriad-voiced concert from screamers on the
wing, from chatterers on domestic affairs in the
rock-ledges, and from brawlers at the parliament
of love out at sea, the surface of which beneath
the rocks is literally thatched at this time of the
year with the wooing multitudes of this happy
commonwealth. If the peace is broken by a
stone rolled over the precipice or by the report
of a gunshot, the air is suddenly darkened by
the rising clouds of the disturbed birds, which,
viewed from the rocks, resemble what might be
taken for gigantic swarms of bees or midges.</p>

<p>‘The method adopted for collecting eggs is the
following: Provided with a strong rope, some
nine or ten stalwart men go to the precipice,
where it is some three hundred feet high, and
one of the number volunteers or is singled out
by the rest for the perilous <i>sig</i>, that is, “sink” or
“drop,” over the edge of the rocks. Round his
thighs and waist, thickly padded generally with
bags stuffed with feathers or hay, the <i>sigamadr</i>,
“sinkman” or “dropman,” adjusts the rope in
such a manner that he may hang, when dropped,
in a sitting posture. He is also dressed in a
wide smock or sack of coarse calico, open at the
breast, and tied round the waist with a belt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_720">{720}</span>
into the ample folds of which he slips the eggs
he gathers, the capacity of the smock affording
accommodation to from one hundred to one
hundred and fifty eggs at a time. In one
hand the sinkman holds a pole, sixteen feet long,
with a ladle tied to one end, and by this means
scoops the eggs out of nests which are beyond
the reach of his own hands. When the purpose
of this “breath-fetching” sink is accomplished,
on a given sign the dropman is hauled up again
by his comrades. This, as may readily be
imagined, is a most dangerous undertaking, and
many a life has been lost over it in Grimsey from
accidents occurring to the rope.</p>

<p>‘For the pursuit of the fishery, the island
possesses fourteen small open boats, in which
the men will venture out as far as four to six
miles cod-fishing; but this is a most hazardous
industry, owing both to the sudden manner in
which the sea will rise, sometimes even a long
time in advance of travelling storms, and to the
difficulty of effecting a landing on the harbourless
island.</p>

<p>‘Now and then the monotony of the life of
the inhabitants is broken by visits from foreigners,
mostly Icelandic shark-fishers, or English or
French fishermen.</p>

<p>‘Of domestic animals the islanders now possess
only a few sheep. Formerly there were five cows
in the island; but the hard winter of 1860 necessitated
their extermination, and since that time,
for twenty-four years, the people have had to
do without a cow! Of horses there are only
two at present (1884) in the island! Strange to
say, the health of the people seems on the whole
to bear a fair comparison with more favoured
localities. Scurvy, which formerly was very
prevalent, has now almost disappeared, as has
also a disease peculiar to children, which, in
the form of spasm or convulsive fit, used to be
very fatal to infant life in former years.</p>

<p>‘Inexpressibly solitary must be the life of these
people in winter, shut out from all communication
with the outer world, and having in view, as far
as the eye can reach, nothing but arctic ice.
The existence of generation after generation here
seems to be spent in one continuous and unavailing
arctic expedition. The only diversion afforded
by nature consists in the shifting colours of the
flickering aurora borealis, in the twinkling of
the stars in the heavens, and the fantastic forms
of wandering icebergs. No wonder that such
surroundings should serve to produce a quiet,
serious, devout, and down-hearted race, in which
respect the Grimsey men may perhaps be said
to constitute a typical group among their compatriots.
However, to dispel the heavy tedium
of the long winter days, they seek their amusements
in the reading of the Sagas, in chess-playing,
and in such mild dissipations at mutual
entertainments at Christmas-time as their splendid
poverty will allow.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FORESTRY_AND_FARMING">FORESTRY AND FARMING.</h2>
</div>


<p>At one of the evening lectures in connection
with the late Edinburgh Forestry Exhibition, Mr
J. Meldrum spoke of the ‘Johore Forests’ which
are situated in the Malayan Peninsula between
the British settlements of Singapore and Malacca.
The greater part of the interior, he said, consisted
of a virgin forest, and abounded in timber trees
of a large size, no fewer than three hundred and
fifty specimens of which were to be seen in the
Forestry Exhibition. About three hundred kinds
awaited the advent of the papermaker, who would
be able to convert them into useful wood-pulp
at a very low cost. Railways were required to
make this wealth of timber available for commercial
purposes.</p>

<p>Another lecture by Mr Cracknell at the model
of the Manitoba Farm embodied some interesting
information regarding the Canadian north-west.
The Bell Farm in Qu’appelle he described as the
largest farm in the world. There were eight
thousand acres under crop, five thousand under
wheat, and a portion of the remainder under
flax. From this farm, ten thousand bushels of
wheat had been exported at a good price last
year; and this year’s crop was estimated to be
forty per cent. better. The estimated wheat acreage
this year in Manitoba is three hundred and
fifty thousand; and in the north-west territories
sixty-five thousand, with an estimated yield of
twenty-three bushels an acre. There was thus a
total of four hundred and fifteen thousand acres,
and nine million five hundred and forty-five thousand
bushels; but deducting two million seven
hundred and sixty thousand bushels for home consumption
and seed, there remained a surplus of
six million seven hundred and eighty-five thousand
bushels. There is little consolation here for
the British farmer, who finds wheat-growing at the
present low prices positively unremunerative.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
